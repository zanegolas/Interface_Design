# MPE LiDAR Midi Interface

### Purpose
This device tracks objects within a given range and translates their position over time into midi data for use with any device that accepts USB Midi. It is easily reproducable with 3D printing and commonly available parts. The device is designed to run without any reprogramming by the end user, but the open source nature allows for deep customization if you so choose.

### Applications
- Parameter modulation based on how members of a band move around on stage
- Allowing dancers to play chords and notes based on their choreography without needing to wear sensors
- Control of the sound in an art installation based on audience movement
- Audience feedback that can control an aspect of the overall performance sound
